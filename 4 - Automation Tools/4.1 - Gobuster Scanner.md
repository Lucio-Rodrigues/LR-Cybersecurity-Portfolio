🧪 Scan Options

Basic Directory Scan
  Uses `common.txt` for quick, high-probability directory discovery.

Deep Directory Scan
  Uses `big.txt` for broader brute-force coverage.

Medium Scan
  Uses `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` from the DirBuster set.

Large Scan
  Uses `directory-list-2.3-small.txt` (don't get tricked by the name, larger than medium).
