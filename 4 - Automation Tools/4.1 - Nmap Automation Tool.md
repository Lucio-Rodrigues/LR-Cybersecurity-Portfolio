# Nmap Automation Tool

This is a Bash-based interactive script that simplifies and automates the use of `Nmap` for reconnaissance and enumeration tasks. Built using nano and pure shell scripting, it provides guided prompts to help users select scan types, input targets, and generate organised outputs with minimal effort.

---

🎯 Purpose

To streamline reconnaissance workflows and reduce the need for memorising `Nmap` syntax. This tool helps both beginners and experienced users quickly run optimised scans in real-world or lab environments like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, or CTF platforms.

---

⚙️ Features

Built entirely in Bash

Interactive user prompts:
 - Target IP or domain
 - Scan type (4 curated scanning modes)
 - Automatically generates proper Nmap commands
 - Includes optional Searchsploit integration
 - Saves scan outputs to organized .txt files with timestamps
 - Designed to support fast recon and follow-up exploitation steps

🧪 Scan Options

Basic Port Scan (Fast)
  Quick default scan of the top 1,000 TCP ports using -sS.

Full Port Scan (All 65535 Ports)
  Exhaustive scan to uncover services running on uncommon ports.

Service & Version Detection
  Detects services and versions running on discovered ports using -sV -sC.

Aggressive Scan (OS, Traceroute, Scripts)
  Comprehensive scan using -A for OS detection, traceroute, and default scripts.

🧠 Why This Tool Matters

This script reduces repetitive typing and lowers the risk of syntax errors, especially in high-paced environments like CTFs, TryHackMe labs, or internal network assessments. It brings consistency, speed, and clarity to one of the most vital phases of offensive security: reconnaissance and vulnerability enumeration.
