# Log Analyser Tool  

This is a Python-based interactive script that simplifies log analysis and security monitoring. Built with regex-driven detection, it provides guided prompts for selecting log files, setting thresholds, and generating organized reports to quickly flag suspicious activity.  

---

🎯 **Purpose**  

To streamline log review workflows and reduce the need for manual log parsing. This tool helps both beginners and security analysts detect brute force attempts, invalid logins, and potential denial-of-service activity in real-world or lab environments like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, or internal monitoring systems.

⚙️ **Features**  

- Built entirely in **Python**  
- Interactive user prompts:  
  - Select log file path at runtime  
  - Set alert thresholds for suspicious activity  
  - Choose to save reports automatically  
- Detects and categorises:  
  - Failed login attempts  
  - Invalid user access  
  - Possible DoS attacks from repeated IPs  
- Generates professional, timestamped reports  
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping for all detections

🧪 **Detection Categories**  

- **Failed Login** – Identifies repeated password failures from the same IP.  
- **Invalid User** – Flags attempts with non-existent accounts.  
- **Possible DoS** – Detects rapid repeated connections simulating denial-of-service.

🚀 **Example Usage**  

```bash
$ python3 analyser.py

=== Log Analyser (Interactive) ===

Enter path to log file [sample_logs.txt]: auth_failures.txt  
Set alert threshold (events per IP) [5]: 3

🧠 Why This Tool Matters

Log review is one of the most important defensive skills in cybersecurity. This script automates repetitive parsing, highlights high-risk activity, and provides consistent reporting. This enables analysts to detect brute force and denial-of-service patterns quickly in both training labs and production systems.
