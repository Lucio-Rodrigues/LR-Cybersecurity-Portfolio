# Lucio Rodrigues – Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio, a curated collection of hands-on projects, lab exercises, automation tools, and professional write-ups that showcase my practical expertise and analytical skills in the field of cybersecurity.

This repository demonstrates my ability to tackle real-world security challenges across multiple domains including:

- **Cloud Security & Home Labs** – Deploying and analysing vulnerable virtual machines, collecting and visualising attack data in real time.  
- **Networking & Infrastructure** – Designing secure network topologies, configuring routing and switching, and applying defensive strategies in simulated environments.  
- **Threat Analysis & Frameworks** – Leveraging MITRE ATT&CK and D3FEND frameworks to identify threats and map effective countermeasures.  
- **Automation & Tool Development** – Building Python and Bash scripts to streamline security workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and analyse large datasets efficiently.  
- **Research & Communication** – Professional blog write-ups that explain attack vectors, defense strategies, and SIEM best practices in clear, actionable terms.

Each folder in this repository contains a complete, standalone project or resource, including code, documentation, and step-by-step guides where applicable. Whether you are a recruiter, hiring manager, or fellow cybersecurity enthusiast, this portfolio is designed to demonstrate not only technical competency but also a structured, thoughtful approach to problem-solving in cybersecurity.

Explore, review, and connect with my work - every project reflects my commitment to learning, innovation, and excellence in the field of cybersecurity.
